Some Democratic lawmakers and biofuels advocates argued that Icahn\\u2019s guidance to the Republican administration created a conflict of interest with his businesses, including oil refining company CVR Energy Inc. Icahn has denied any conflict of interest. Icahn\\u2019s departure followed a flurry of changes at the White House. Trump on Friday fired his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, two days after disbanding two high-profile business advisory groups. \\u201cI chose to end this arrangement (with your blessing) because I did not want partisan bickering about my role to in any way cloud your administration,\\u201d Icahn wrote in a letter to Trump released on his website. The White House declined to comment. A call to Icahn\\u2019s office was not immediately returned. The activist investor, who leads Icahn Enterprises LP, was an early and close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican for his business acumen. One of Icahn\\u2019s first tasks was to vet the future Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and a number of candidates met with the octogenarian investor in his Fifth Avenue office just a few blocks north of Trump Tower in Manhattan. While Icahn stopped managing money for clients years ago, he still has large stakes in companies like Herbalife Ltd , CVR and American International Group Inc , which have faced regulatory issues.     Icahn was so sure Trump\\u2019s election last year would give a boost to stocks that he left the campaign\\u2019s victory party to make a $1 billion bet on the market, he told Reuters last year. The day after the election, stocks leapt. In his letter to Trump, Icahn downplayed his role as an adviser on regulatory matters, saying \\u201cI never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position.\\u201d Trump, who came to office promising to roll back regulation, reform the tax code and boost infrastructure spending, never put Icahn on the payroll. But Icahn\\u2019s involvement was considerable. He interviewed Scott Pruitt, now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the very agency that would determine regulations about requiring refiners to blend biofuels. His web of financial interests became a lightning rod. \\u201cIf he was not willing to admit he was a de facto special government employee, and follow the rules, then he had no place serving in government,\\u201d said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. \\u201cHis short tenure, marred by serious conflicts allegations, was yet another black eye for an administration that has become notorious for violations of ethics and the rule of law.\\u201d Icahn has been one of the loudest critics of the federal biofuels program, and he was working at price-crushing reforms of the program at the same time he was betting that credits at the center of the program would fall. Biofuels regulations require refiners either to blend biofuels into gasoline or - in the case of companies like CVR that have no blending facilities - to buy credits from competitors. The regulation, the Renewable Fuel Standard, also allows companies to delay those credit purchases by a year. As an adviser to Trump, Icahn urged the president in February to alter the policy to lift the blending burden from refiners. Yet environmental regulators are preparing to formally reject that proposal, sources told Reuters. Investors have built up a large short position in CVR in the past three months, according to Reuters data, as evidence mounts that the company\\u2019s gamble on the biofuels market is going sour.   \",\n          \"The first thing Donald Trump should have thought about on Tuesday morning is all the American soldiers who sacrificed their lives 73 years ago.On the beaches of Normandy in France, American troops faced the heaviest fire in what is still the largest amphibious operation ever conducted. Many never even made it off the boats that carried them to shore. As depicted in the film Saving Private Ryan, June 6, 1943 was a bloody and terrifying day.But instead of thinking about those brave men today on the anniversary of D-Day, Trump chose to only think about himself.In yet another early morning rant on Twitter, Trump attacked the media and listed basically every channel except Fox News as fake news and once again bragged about winning the election.The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017Trump then bragged that he is going to end the threat of terrorism just because he visited Saudi Arabia and then he attacked one of our strategic allies in the Middle East.During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar   look!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017It should be noted that Qatar has been our ally since 1973. But Trump wasn t done attacking them.So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017Seriously, Trump literally just accused one of our longtime allies of funding terrorism because Saudi Arabia told him to. Qatar officials deny the allegations.But Trump s attack on Qatar is also hypocritical considering Saudi Arabia has also been repeatedly accused of funding terrorism. The Saudis are also significantly tied to the 9/11 attacks, but you don t see Trump attacking them.The tension between Qatar and other Middle Eastern nations has been building for quite some time now. Trump s pathetic speech during his embarrassing trip overseas had nothing to do with what s happening at the moment. But Trump is trying to take credit anyway.As Trump continues to cause worldwide chaos and insults our European allies, the anniversary of D-Day should be even more important than ever before.29,000 Americans lost their lives that day on the blood-soaked sand and water. To put that figure in perspective, that s more killed in one day than the entire eight-year war in Iraq in which 4,424 American troops were killed.And if we continue to let Trump and his administration remain in power, we could end up fighting another world war that will be even costlier.Featured Image: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\",\n          \"Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch has not announced a specific day for the bill\\u2019s release and said only that it would be toward the end of the week.   Axios reported on Wednesday that the bill would be delayed past Thursday, but the source told Reuters it was on track to be released that day. Friday is a U.S. holiday and the Senate will not be in session. The House of Representatives released its version of the tax  legislation backed by Republican President Donald Trump last week and is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior Republican said. Passing the tax overhaul has been a priority for Trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. But Republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since the president took office in January, even though the party controls also both chambers of Congress. \",\n          \" Andrew Jackson Biographer: Trump Actually Said He Could Have Prevented The Civil War (VIDEO) Donald Trump s Andrew Jackson-Civil War debacle just continues to get worse and worse.Yesterday, Trump had a massive history fail during a radio interview, where the moronic POTUS stated that Andrew Jackson   who had died 16 years before the Civil War even started   was angry that the war had not been avoided. Trump also said that Jackson could have stopped the Civil War from happening, lavishing praise upon the slave-owning seventh president. And apparently, Trump also thinks that HE could have stopped the Civil War.Trump s disgusting Civil War comments have prompted Andrew Jackson biographer and historian Jon Meacham, the author of  American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House, to speak out and address Trump s comments. According to Meacham, it was White House chief strategist Steve Bannon that made Trump fall in love with Jackson. The historian explained on MSNBC today: I spent an hour, hour and a half with him in May of  16 talking with him about presidents he admired and Jackson never came up. Steve Bannon put this in the conversation after the victory saying this was a Jacksonian moment. It was then that Trump connected himself to Jackson in his usual superficial way. Meacham said: It s a projection of the president s fundamental and enveloping narcissism. And then Meacham dropped this bombshell: He told me a year and a half ago or so, a year ago, that, you know, he thought he could have done a deal to have averted the war. Yes, Trump actually said he could have prevented the war with one of his deals. If it s anything like the  deals  and failed legislation we ve seen so far during his presidency, it s safe to say that Trump would have f*cked that up, too.Meacham also said that being in the White House tends to enhance the  fundamental characteristics  of the serving presidents   which is awful news for America right now. Meacham said: It s very hard, once you re there, to change. Some people do, and that s why we talk about them as great presidents. But most people, once they re in the Oval Office, actually just become more like themselves   and I think in this case that s on a particularly tragic trajectory. We couldn t agree more.
